# library-system
An integrated library system that a library can use to keep track of books and help users find books.

## Compiling and running.
One way to compile it is to use Eclipse. First open Eclipse (install if necessary). Click on the "Code" button on Github and select "Download ZIP". Open Eclipse and click "File", "Import", "General", "Projects from Folder or Archive". Make sure "Search for nested projects" is on. Click the "Archive..." not "Directory..." button, and find where you downloaded "library-system-main.zip" to. Maybe three projects will be listed. Uncheck all the boxes but check the box for project "library-system-main.zip_expanded/library-system-main/cosc310_T28_librarySystem". Click finish.

Now the project should be in Eclipse. In the Eclipse project explorer, find and open the file "cosc310_T28_librarySystem/src/cosc310_T28_librarySystem/main.java". While the file is open, click "Run" and "Run" or click the green (>) button. This will automatically compile the .class files inside "cosc310_T28_librarySystem/bin" which might not be visible in the Eclipse project explorer. For the current version, you can only interact with the program using a terminal, e.g. the Eclipse "Console" where you should see the program after you run it.
